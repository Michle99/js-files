            The following is a list of colors. 
            A number of the color swatches below are taken from domain-specific naming schemes such as X11 or HTML4. 
            RGB values are given for each swatch because such standards are defined in terms of the sRGB color space. 
            It is not possible to accurately convert many of these swatches to CMYK values because of the differing gamuts of the two spaces, 
            but the color management systems built into operating systems and image editing software attempt such conversions as accurately as possible.
